# C2SIM-SERVER

This project provides the **reference implementation of the C2SIM Server**, acting as a **central distribution hub** for interoperable Command and Control (C2), simulation, and robotic/autonomous systems.

The server is based on the **SISO C2SIM standards**:

- **SISO-STD-019-2020** defines standardized interoperability between **C2 systems**, **simulation systems**, and **robotic/autonomous systems (RAS)**.

- **SISO-STD-020-2020** extends the core standard with **land warfare–specific concepts and data models**.

The **C2SIM Server** enables multiple heterogeneous systems to exchange initialization data, orders, requests, and reports through a **common semantic and messaging framework**, reducing the need for point-to-point integrations.

This implementation is the successor to the [GMU C2SIM Server](https://github.com/OpenC2SIM/OpenC2SIM.github.io), continuing and modernizing the reference architecture originally developed by George Mason University.
